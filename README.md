## üéØ Reasons for a WEB3 CMS

Approximately 64-65% of websites use a CMS as part of their structure. Largely based on Web2 structures, they face inherent limitations:

### ‚ùå Problems with Traditional (Web2) CMS

- **Poor Source Verification:** Lack of robust mechanisms to authenticate content origin, facilitating the spread of Fake News.
- **Misuse of Data:** Web2 structures often treat the user as a product, exploiting and monetizing personal data without full consent.
- **Prior Censorship:** Centralized CMSs are susceptible to censorship, often prior, allowing content removal and tampering by governments or corporations.
- **Compromised Digital Archaeology:** Significant risk of loss and manipulation of historical content records.
- **Lack of Transparency:** Absence of transparency and immutable records in content transactions and management.
- **Weakened Security:** Centralized systems are more vulnerable to cyberattacks, exposing sensitive data.

### ‚úÖ Opportunities and Solutions with Web3 CMS

- **Content Ownership:** Empowers users with direct and proprietary control over their content.
- **Transaction Transparency:** Uses blockchain to ensure immutable records and verifiable authentication.
- **Native Payment Methods:** Blockchain provides a secure and efficient structure for transactions without intermediaries.
- **Economic Incentives:** Introduction of reward systems using tokens, fairly incentivizing content creators.
- **Greater Security:** Decentralized structure enhances security against cyberattacks.
- **Advanced Interoperability:** Polkadot architecture enables effective, low-cost communication between various decentralized networks.
- **Structural Resilience:** Distributed implementation ensures constant content availability and integrity.
- **Encrypted Content:** Native encryption ensures data protection and compacts large volumes of information into secure hashes.

### üöÄ Present and Near Future

- **AI Integration:** Use of artificial intelligence for enhanced personalization, automation, and content analysis.
- **Headless CMS:** Increased flexibility through decoupling the front-end from the back-end, allowing content dissemination across multiple platforms and devices.
- **Data Cross-Referencing via APIs and MCPs:** Integration and cross-referencing of data from multiple sources through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) encapsulated in MCPs (Anthropic Standard), enabling the creation of unprecedented services.

---

## üéØ Product Objective and Differentiator

### Main Features

- **SaaS - Software as a Service:** Local or cloud service offering a digital service to users.
- **Open Source:** The project grows organically without relying on a centralizing entity or corporation, and should include a community of developers, enthusiasts, and non-technical users.
- **Headless:** Can be used as an output hub in multiple formats, enhanced by intensive AI use (a parent content can be reprocessed into countless child contents).
- **WEB3 Authentication:** Provides native infrastructure for a CMS to be forced into multiple use cases such as EAD platforms, E-commerce, Institutional Sites, Small Business Sites, DAO Platforms, Forums, Intranets (with controlled subscription flows), Consultation Systems and Public Services, Authentication Platforms (for document registration), etc.

### Competitive Differentiator

- **First native Web3 CMS** on the Polkadot network
- **Native AI integration** with RAG and MCP
- **Decentralized governance** via DAO
- **Tokenized ecosystem** for incentives
- **Cross-chain interoperability** via Polkadot

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

### Radix UI
[Official site](https://www.radix-ui.com/) is a library of unstyled, accessible interface primitives (dialogs, dropdowns, toasts, etc.) integrated via React imports. It provides the behavior and accessibility, but not the visual style.

### TailwindCSS
[Official site](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for utility-first styling, allowing rapid prototyping and consistent design through utility classes in JSX. Tailwind acts as the "glue" between Radix UI primitives and the project's global styles defined in `globals.css`, enabling seamless visual integration and customization.

### globals.css
Is used for global styles, resets, and custom rules that complement Tailwind and are not easily covered by utility classes.

### npm
(Node Package Manager) controls the flow of communication and integration between these libraries. It manages the installation, versioning, and updates of Radix UI, TailwindCSS, and all other dependencies, ensuring that the correct versions are used and that all packages work together seamlessly within the project.

All customizations are performed via Tailwind classes, configuration files, or project-specific CSS, never by modifying the source code of external dependencies.

### Main Project Dependencies

- **@polkadot/api**: Connects and interacts with the Polkadot blockchain, enabling queries, transactions, and on-chain data access.
- **@polkadot/extension-dapp**: Facilitates communication between the web app and Polkadot wallet browser extensions for authentication and account access.
- **@polkadot/extension-inject**: Supports account injection and signing features from Polkadot extensions.
- **@radix-ui/react-dialog, @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu, @radix-ui/react-toast**: Accessible, unstyled UI primitives for dialogs, dropdowns, and toasts.
- **lucide-react**: SVG icon library for React, used for modern, customizable icons.
- **next**: React framework for SSR, SSG, routing, and performance optimizations.
- **react**: Main library for building user interfaces with components.
- **react-dom**: Renders React components to the browser DOM.
- **@eslint/eslintrc, eslint, eslint-config-next**: Linting tools for code quality and consistency.
- **@tailwindcss/postcss, tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework and its processor.
- **typescript, @types/node, @types/react, @types/react-dom**: TypeScript and type definitions for static typing and code safety.

### Visualizing Dependencies

To visualize the relationship between dependencies in this project, you can use a Mermaid diagram with straight, angular lines by adding the following configuration at the top:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'flowchart': {'curve': 'linear'}}}%%
flowchart LR
    npm["npm (Dependency Manager)"]
    npm --> NextJS["Next.js (Framework)"]
    npm --> React["React"]
    npm --> Radix["Radix UI (Dialog, Dropdown, Toast)"]
    npm --> Lucide["Lucide React (SVG Icons)"]
    npm --> Tailwind["TailwindCSS"]
    npm --> PolkadotAPI["@polkadot/api"]
    npm --> PolkadotExtDapp["@polkadot/extension-dapp"]
    npm --> PolkadotExtInject["@polkadot/extension-inject"]
    npm --> TypeScript["TypeScript"]
    npm --> ESLint["ESLint"]
    npm --> PostCSS["PostCSS"]
    npm --> TypesReact["@types/react, @types/react-dom, @types/node"]
    NextJS --> React

    Tailwind --> Globals["globals.css"]
    Radix --> Tailwind
    NextJS --> PolkadotAPI
    NextJS --> PolkadotExtDapp
    NextJS --> PolkadotExtInject
    NextJS --> TypeScript
    NextJS --> ESLint

    Tailwind --> PostCSS
    TypeScript --> TypesReact
    classDef main fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    class npm main
```

This configuration ensures all lines are straight and angular, and the diagram now clearly shows npm as the central manager of all dependencies, illustrating its role in controlling installation, versioning, and integration.
